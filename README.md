Image classification with SIFT and Neural network
## SIFT + Bag-of-words + Kmeans + SVC
First, we use the scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) algorithm  to extract a set of key features for images in the dataset; The extracted key features are invariant to image translation, scaling, and rotation, as well as partial invariant to illumination changes and robustness to geometric distortions. Then, k-means clustering algorithm is used to cluster the extracted key feature vectors, which provides a set of codewords to form the dictionary of our bag-of-words (BOW) representation. Next, for the extracted SIFT features of an image, we assign each feature to the closest BOW, which allows us to express the image as a histogram of BOW. 
Finally, we train the corresponding histograms of labelled images with Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm, to get the SVM image classifier. For the unlabeled images, we classify the BOW presentations with the SVM image classifier. The output is a vector of probability classified to each category and the category with maximum probability is the label of the unlabeled image.
